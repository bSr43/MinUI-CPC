# Amstrad CPC emulator for MinUI / NextUI

This release is for the TrimUI Brick.
It hasn't been tested on anything else.

Extract the content of the ZIP file at the root of your SD card.

Once done, add your games to the Roms folder, using the *CPC* tag, for instance, create a folder named *Roms/Amstrad CPC (CPC)*.

You can bring up the keyboard by pressing *select* and *start* at the same time.

_Note_: this emulator requires NextUI version 2.6.3 or higher.
